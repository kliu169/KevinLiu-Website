        <p class="lead mb-4">Business Intern<br><br>

       Kevin Liu was born in Louisiana and stayed there until he was five years old. He then stayed in Shanghai for 7 years, Pennsylvania for half a year,New Jersey for a year and a half, and Currently living in California and it has been almost 4 years. He likes watching anime, playing basketball, and looking at girls. He is also a big foodie and he is always down to eat. There are also things that Kevin does not like. Kevin does not like drinking soda because that makes him feel gross and easily full. He does not like eating spicy food because he has a sensitive stomach and it will give him intense diarrhea. He graduated from Walnut High School and he is now a current freshman at the University of California Riverside. In high school, he took 6 APs and passed all of them. He also attended several clubs in high school: DreamCatchers, Key, Leo, Anime, INCC. He graduated high school with honors, GPA 3.5. Maybe it is because of the moving from time to time, Kevin is able to communicate with people freely. He is not shy to make interactions with others and friends are always around Kevin. However, things changed in college. Kevin is a very bright person and people frequently see him as a jokester.  <br><br>

        At the Universityof California- Riverside, he is studying there as a Pre-Business major. He has not yet declared his concentration of business yet but he is considering focusing on information Systems. He has not yet found an Internship but he has worked as a sushi server at Zip Fusion Sushi and Kbbq. With the constant pressure of surrounding people, he is deciding what club or frat to rush because in the field of business,networking is very important. Connections are everything you need when you graduate in the field of business and now Kevin is struggling with that. In high school, he was a super talkative kid but in college, something just doesn't feel the same anymore. People look terrifying for no reason and I canâ€™t find a friend group other than sticking with my old high school friends. He does have a couple of friends in his classes but they are not as close as a friend group. They are more like friends caused by proximity. This does not mean he does not possess the ability to communicate. He just does not know how to start a conversation out of nowhere. When assigned on a mission or a task, he is still able to carry it out. Kevin is in a desperate search for a job because his parents do not live with him. He realizes how much his parents are making to support their three children living in the United States with no financial aid. Kevin does not think that a random job would be enough in order to pay back his parentsâ€™ efforts. Kevin is willing to use all of the strength he can in the future to ensure that companies would like him and try to secure a high paying job that he enjoys. Honestly, Kevin does not know if business is the way to go for him since he does not know how to talk to people professionally. He has no other way to go because he does not have any interest in any other yield of studies besides business that can make money. He likes different cultures, but there are no jobs that are offered out there that can provide him a decent pay and are related to different cultures.
